Keybow is an easy-to-build, solderless, DIY mini mechanical keyboard, Raspberry Pi-powered, with twelve illuminated keys, hot-swap clicky or linear switches, clear keycaps, and awesome customisable layouts and macros. It's the ultimate macro pad.

This Keybow OS is RAM-disk-based and built upon a stripped-down Raspbian, with C bindings that setup and run the USB HID, and a series of Lua-based scripts to customise the key layouts and lighting.

## Using the Keybow software

Format a micro-SD card in FAT32 format (we recommend the SD Association's [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/), and then drop the contents of the [sdcard](sdcard) folder (only the files inside the folder) onto the freshly-formatted micro-SD card.
